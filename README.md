# Pollution Tracker

**Pollution Tracker** is a project by the **Clean Air Council** that brings together environmental compliance data for industrial facilities along the **Delaware River**.

It pulls data from:
- [EPAâ€™s ECHO system](https://echo.epa.gov/)
- [PA Department of Environmental Protection](https://www.dep.pa.gov/)

â€¦and makes it easier to:
- See which facilities are emitting what (and how much)
- Track violations, inspections, and enforcement actions
- Explore trends in air and water pollution over time
- Focus on the communities most affected

The goal is simple:  
**Make pollution data accessible to the people who live with its consequences.**

## What You Get

- An interactive map of facilities along the Delaware River
- Compliance and emissions history at your fingertips
- Search + filter by location, facility, permit status, or pollutant
- Easy-to-read summaries and links to source data

## Why?

Pollution data exists â€” but itâ€™s scattered, hard to navigate, and often buried in PDFs or spreadsheets. Pollution Tracker brings it all into one place, in a format thatâ€™s easy to use whether you're an advocate, researcher, or concerned neighbor.

## Whoâ€™s Behind It?

Built and maintained by the [Clean Air Council](https://cleanair.org), a nonprofit working for everyoneâ€™s right to breathe clean air.
