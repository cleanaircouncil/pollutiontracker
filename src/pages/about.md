Clean Air Council helps residents track industrial permitting across Southeastern Pennsylvania and neighboring regions. This tool is based on years of Clean Air Council's work getting the public involved with the permitting of individual industrial pollution sources. Click any pollution source to view the Council's previous work as well as industrial permitting information and current environmental violations for individual facilities. Reach out to Russell Zerbo at [rzerbo@cleanair.org](mailto:rzerbo@cleanair.org).

Southeast Pennsylvania fails federal ambient air quality standards and residents in this region report high prevalences of asthma and other respiratory problems. The Council hopes helping residents engage with local industrial facilities will reduce air pollution and protect public health in Southeastern Pennsylvania.
